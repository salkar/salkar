### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a web developer. My main tech stack: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript [React, Redux]. Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js.

I have extensive experience in startups (web, 3 of them were successfully sold). 

Metabar [2011-2013, as QA engineer] => sold to Yandex.

RO!RS [2015-2016, as backend developer] => sold to Calltouch.

Potok.io [2016-2018, as backend developer] => sold to Severgroup

I believe in small teams of professionals. I'm not afraid of new technologies.
